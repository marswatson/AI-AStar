# AI Astar project

*	Created and visualized a 2D terrain discretized into a grid of square cells with four different types randomly. The cost of transition between two types were different. 
*	Implemented uniform-cost search, normal A*, weighted A*, sequential heuristic A* and integrated heuristic A* algorithms to find the path between start and goal points.
*	Compared the different A* performance in speed and memory efficiency with different maps and different heuristic functions.

The creatMap.py is used to create new map for Astar search map. Astarxxx.py are different Astart algorithms. You can run main.py directly to see different result.
